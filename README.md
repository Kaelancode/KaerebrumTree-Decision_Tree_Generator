# KaerebrumTree-Decision_Tree_Generator
### Decision Tree Application to 
1.  draw decision tree maps 
2.  choice of map layouts
3.  generate code for reproduction
4.  able to train categorical data


The algorithm is build from scratch using numpy and graphviz.\
Using streamlit for quick frontend deployment of a nice looking dashboard.
