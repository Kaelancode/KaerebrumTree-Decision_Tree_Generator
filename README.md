# KaerebrumTree-Decision_Tree_Generator
### Decision Tree Application to 
1.  draw decision tree maps 
2.  Nice detailed tree maps with choice of map layouts
3.  generate decision rules as code for reproduction
4.  able to train categorical data


The algorithm is build from scratch using numpy and graphviz.\
Using streamlit for quick frontend deployment of a nice looking dashboard.
